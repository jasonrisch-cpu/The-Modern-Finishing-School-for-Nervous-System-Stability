PEP #1: Pricing Without Self-Attack**

This is where the system leaves theory.

And touches money.

Which is where most people lose their minds.

Pricing is one of the fastest ways to reveal whether someone is regulated.

Because it hits, all at once:

Self-worth

Scarcity

Comparison

Fear of rejection

Fear of being “too much”

Fear of being “not enough”


That’s why people freeze in front of calculators.

It’s not math.

It’s identity under load.

The Crochet Story

This system didn’t start in a lab.

It started at a kitchen table.

With my wife, Kelly.

A calculator.

A pile of beautiful handmade work.

And absolutely no idea what number to write down.

She wasn’t bad at math.

She knew the cost of yarn.
She knew the time involved.
She knew the quality was high.

But when it came time to choose a price?

She stalled.

Not for minutes.

For hours.

Because choosing a number felt like choosing her value.

Every option felt dangerous.

Too low: “I’m disrespecting myself.”
Too high: “Who do I think I am?”
Middle: “What if I’m wrong?”

So she avoided deciding.

That’s not laziness.

That’s a nervous system protecting itself from threat.


---

The First Anchor: Three Times Cost

When I faced the same problem years earlier with embroidery, I went back to something old tradespeople had used forever:

Three times cost.

Materials.
Labor.
Margin.

Replace what you used.
Pay yourself.
Leave room for error.

It’s not perfect.

It’s stable.

And stability comes first.


---

From Point Price to Envelope

The breakthrough was this:

The problem isn’t the number.

The problem is being forced to pick a single number under pressure.

So we stopped picking points.

We built a range.

An envelope.

First, calculate true cost.

Call it C.

Include:

Materials

Tools

Wear and tear

Basic overhead


Be honest.

Self-deception here poisons everything downstream.

Then multiply:

Floor = 3 × C

Center = 6 × C

Ceiling = 12 × C


Now you have a field instead of a point.

You are no longer trapped.

You are oriented.


---

Why 3 / 6 / 12 Works

These are not magic numbers.

They are heuristic anchors.

They come from:

Craft tradition

Cost-plus pricing

Survival economics

Observed calibration


3× keeps you alive.
6× keeps you stable.
12× marks high-load territory.

Most regulated people naturally settle near the middle.

Not because they’re told to.

Because their bodies recognize it as clean.


---

The Envelope Model

Once you have the range, you stop asking:

> “What’s the right price?”



And start asking:

> “Where inside this is stable?”



Now you’re not defending a number.

You’re operating inside a system.

The system carries the emotional load.


---

Somatic Pricing: Using the Body as Feedback

Here is the step most systems never teach.

After you calculate the envelope, you do not choose immediately.

You regulate.

You run a brief internal check.

Like this:

Look at the floor price.

Pause.

Notice your body.

Do you feel:

Collapse?

Urgency?

Shame?

Tightness?

Desperation?


Then look at the ceiling.

Pause again.

Notice.

Do you feel:

Inflation?

Fear?

Posturing?

Contraction?

Defensiveness?


You are not “reading intuition.”

You are reading arousal and tension.

You are checking how each number loads the system.

Just like testing grip strength.

Too low → collapse.
Too high → strain.
Clean → stable engagement.

That signal is data.

Use it.


---

Pricing Is Isometric Control

Think back to the hand exercise.

When you clenched too hard, you crushed.

When you over-stretched, you strained.

In the middle, with moderate opposing tension, you had control.

Pricing works the same way.

A clean price feels:

Firm

Relaxed

Defensible

Breathable


Not limp.
Not aggressive.

Stable.

That is isometric balance applied to money.


---

The 51/49 Symmetry Break

Even with the envelope, people get stuck.

They narrow:

$75 or $85.

Then freeze.

Perfect tie.

No signal.

So you break symmetry.

Deliberately.

51% one way.
49% the other.

And ship.

Not because it’s “right.”

Because movement lowers gain.

Stalling raises it.

Motion generates data.

Stalling generates anxiety.


---

Regulation > Optimization

Most business advice says:

> “Optimize.”



This system says:

> “Stabilize first.”



A regulated person at 80% efficiency outperforms a dysregulated person at 120% effort.

Every time.

Because they:

Adjust faster

Learn faster

Recover faster

Abandon bad strategies sooner


PEP is not about squeezing the market.

It’s about staying functional inside it.


---

Confidence as a Byproduct

Once Kelly had the envelope:

She didn’t need pep talks.

She didn’t need affirmations.

She had structure.

So she chose.

And when she could choose:

Her shoulders dropped.
Her voice softened.
Her body relaxed.

Customers felt it.

Sales followed.

Not because she “believed in herself.”

Because she wasn’t fighting herself.


---

The End-of-Day Test

At fairs, something interesting happened.

When business was good:

She’d lower a price.
Or gift a piece.

Not from fear.

From abundance.

“We’re good. Let’s make someone happy.”

That’s regulation.

Freedom under load.


---

Why This Works Everywhere

This isn’t about crochet.

It’s about exchange.

Invoices.
Fees.
Raises.
Contracts.
Projects.

Anywhere value meets identity.

The same freeze appears.

The same cure works.


---

Common Misunderstanding: “Charge More”

This is not a system for raising prices.

Sometimes it raises them.
Sometimes it lowers them.

It always cleans them.

If you’re undercharging, you rise.
If you’re overcharging, you settle.

The target is not profit.

It is coherence.


---

When the Market Rejects Your Floor

If you can’t sell at 3× repeatedly, one of four things is wrong:

1. Your C is wrong


2. Your market is wrong


3. Your framing is wrong


4. The work isn’t viable



PEP tells you early.

That’s mercy.


---

The First Proof

This chapter matters because it proves something.

Not philosophically.

Mechanically.

A person who froze now moves.
A person who doubted now trusts process.
A person who self-attacked now calibrates.

No belief required.

No ideology.

Just feedback and control.


---

Summary

Pricing isn’t a business problem.

It’s a regulation problem.

The envelope creates range.
The body provides feedback.
The 51/49 rule creates motion.
Structure replaces self-attack.

Confidence follows.

Not the other way around.

This is the first proof that the system works.

More are coming.
