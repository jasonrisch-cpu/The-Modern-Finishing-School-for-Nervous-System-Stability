Dualistic Sliders: Approach / Avoid**

Everything you do is shaped by two basic signals:

Move toward.
Move away.

That’s it.

Every preference, reaction, craving, and resistance reduces to this structure.

In your system, these are sliders.

Not moral issues.
Not personality flaws.
Not character defects.

Control signals.


---

The Approach / Avoid Axis

Every object in experience triggers one of three responses:

Move toward it
Move away from it
Leave it alone

Approach and avoid are not “good” and “bad.”

They are directional instructions.

They tell the system where to send energy.


---

Liking and Disliking as Amplifiers

When you say:

“I like this.”

You are telling the system:

Increase signal.
Increase proximity.
Increase repetition.

That is positive amplification.

When you say:

“I don’t like this.”

You are telling the system:

Push away.
Suppress.
Remove.

That is also amplification.

Because pushing requires energy.


---

Why Both Add Energy

Most people think disliking reduces energy.

It doesn’t.

It applies energy in the opposite direction.

Trying to suppress a thought takes effort.
Trying to resist a feeling creates tension.
Trying not to care requires work.

“I don’t want this” is still engagement.

It is still gain applied to the object.


---

Positive and Negative Feedback Loops

Positive feedback loop:

Like → Seek → Reward → Like more

Negative feedback loop:

Dislike → Resist → Tension → Dislike more

Both are loops.
Both sustain activation.
Neither is neutral.


---

The Trap of “I Don’t Like This”

Watch closely.

“I don’t like this person.”
“I don’t like this feeling.”
“I don’t like this situation.”

The body tightens.
Attention locks.
Narrative builds.

Energy rises.

You didn’t weaken the signal.

You reinforced it.

Avoidance is counter-force.

Not attenuation.


---

The Slider Model

Each dualistic pair is a slider:

+10 = Maximum approach
0   = Neutral
–10 = Maximum avoidance

Most people live between +8 and –8.

High spikes.
Hard crashes.
Chronic drama.

The system overheats.


---

The +1 / –1 Life

Stability lives near center.

+1 = mild preference
–1 = mild preference

Enough signal to act.
Not enough to destabilize.

You still enjoy.
You still dislike.

But the oscillation is small.

That’s sustainable.

This is life lived near zero:
balanced tone with live gain.


---

Gain vs Slider (Critical Distinction)

Sliders are direction.
Gain is global force — the volume of energy in the system.

Example:

+2 approach at low gain → gentle interest
+2 approach at high gain → obsession

–2 avoid at low gain → mild boundary
–2 avoid at high gain → rage

Same slider.
Different pressure.

Most people try to fix the object.

They should fix the force.


---

Sliders Create Momentum

This is rarely taught.

Moving a slider creates motion.

Like steering a vehicle.

Push forward → you move forward.
Turn left → you start turning.

Inputs create momentum.

Momentum continues
after you stop pushing.


---

Why People Oscillate

Untrained systems do this:

+5 → overshoot → –6 → overshoot → +7 → crash

Push.
Panic.
Counter-push.
Overcorrect.

Life becomes constant recovery.

No stability.


---

The Egg-Grasp Problem

Modern robots can pick up an egg.

To do that, they must:

Locate it
Align with it
Apply force
Monitor feedback
Adjust continuously

Too little force → drop.
Too much force → crush.

Human regulation is the same.

Relationships, pricing, boundaries, emotions:

You are always gripping something.

With too much force.
Or too little.

Training teaches calibrated grip.


---

Isometric Balance (Holding a Position)

Think of holding your hand steady.

You activate:

Flexors and extensors
Push and pull
Stabilize and release

At the same time.

That is isometric control.

Power without movement.

The nervous system does this too.

When trained, it can:

Hold +3 interest without obsession
Hold –3 boundary without rage
Hold engagement without collapse

This is active balance.

Not slack.
Not force.

Control.


---

How Stability Actually Works

To hold any setting, you need:

1. Direction (slider)


2. Force (gain)


3. Damping (SBR)



Calibration sets the baseline.
SBR holds it.
Sliders steer it.

Remove any one:

No direction → drift
No force → collapse
No damping → oscillation

All three are required.


---

Landing a Setting: The SBR Sequence

When you want to hold a position:

1. Set the slider


2. Raise gain slightly (to stop drift)


3. Stare — contain


4. Breathe — synchronize


5. Relax — discharge excess



Then the system settles.

Like leveling a helicopter.

Without this:

You overshoot.
You wobble.
You burn energy.


---

Craving as Containment (Without Mysticism)

In early regulation, you often use effort.

You “hold yourself.”

You clamp attention.
You restrain impulses.
You prevent spirals.

This is not failure.

It is scaffolding.

With training, less force is needed.

Containment becomes natural.


---

Practical Application

When you feel pulled hard:

Ask:

Which slider is active?
How far from zero?
What is my gain?
Is there momentum?

Usually:

Lower gain.
Stabilize.
Then adjust.

Not the reverse.


---

The Hidden Insight

Approach and avoid are not the problem.

Unregulated force and unmanaged momentum are.

When gain is stable and SBR is trained:

Sliders become tools.

When gain is high and SBR is weak:

Sliders become tyrants.


---

What Mastery Looks Like

A trained system can:

Engage without obsession
Disengage without collapse
Care without clinging
Set boundaries without anger

That is not temperament.

That is skill.


---

What Comes Next

Now that you understand:

Direction
Force
Momentum
Stability

We can talk about:

How much gain a human system can safely carry.

The window of tolerance.

The economics of energy.

Sustainable power.
