**Chapter 4

Calibration Protocol v1.0
How to Zero the Board**

Mindfulness lets you read the dashboard.

Calibration lets you touch the controls.

This chapter teaches you how to tune your internal system deliberately instead of reacting to it.

Not by suppression.
Not by forcing.
By adjustment.


---

The Mixing Board Model

Think of your inner system like a sound mixing board.

It has:

Individual sliders (specific tendencies)

A master gain knob (overall intensity)


Each slider runs from:

–10 ← 0 → +10

Negative is not “bad.”
Positive is not “good.”

They are directions of pressure.

Zero is balance.


---

What the Sliders Represent

Every human system runs on paired forces:

Approach / Avoid

Liking / Disliking

Engage / Withdraw

Push / Pull

Assert / Yield

Speed / Slow


Each pair behaves like a slider.

You are always somewhere on each one.

Most people do not know where.

Calibration makes location visible.


---

+10 / –10: What Extremes Look Like

At the extremes, sliders stop being useful.

They become expensive.

+10 looks like:

Overdrive
Compulsion
Fixation
Forcing
“I must.” “I need.” “I can’t stop.”

–10 looks like:

Collapse
Suppression
Shutdown
Withdrawal
“I can’t.” “I won’t.” “I’m done.”

Different direction.
Same cost.

Both burn energy.


---

A Physical Demonstration of +10 / –10

Before we talk abstractly, feel it.

Do this now.

Take your dominant hand.
Hold it in front of you.

Step 1 — +10 (Clench)

Slowly curl your hand into a fist.

Do not hurt yourself.
Just tighten.

Now tighten more.

Add a little more pressure.

Notice:

Tension increases

Muscles harden

Effort rises

Heat builds

Fatigue begins


More pressure = more load.

This is +10.


---

Step 2 — Return to Zero

Open your hand.

Let it rest.

Do not pose it.
Do not arrange it.

Let it fall naturally.

Notice the difference.

That easy, open position?

That is zero.

Available.
Alive.
Ready.


---

Step 3 — –10 (Opposite Tension)

Now spread your fingers wide.

Pull them back.
Bend your wrist.
Stretch.

Pull harder.

Notice:

Different muscles

Same tension

Same fatigue

Same strain


This is –10.

Opposite direction.
Same cost.


---

Step 4 — Return to Zero Again

Relax.

Let the hand settle.

Notice how quickly relief appears.

Notice how the body prefers this state.

That is homeostasis.


---

What This Demonstrates

Clench (+10) → tension.
Overstretch (–10) → tension.

Different form.
Same load.

Zero is different.

Zero is:

Balanced tone

Minimal effort

Maximum availability


This is the reference state.


---

Natural Baselines

Look at relaxed hands in a room.

No two are identical.

But they are similar.

Each person has a personal neutral.

It lives inside a narrow range.

Same with nervous systems.

Calibration teaches you to find yours.


---

Global Gain: The Master Knob

Gain is not a slider.

It is system-wide intensity.

It controls:

How loud sensations feel

How fast thoughts move

How reactive emotions are

How urgent everything seems


High gain → sharp and close.
Low gain → soft and distant.

Gain determines whether regulation is possible.


---

Sliders vs Gain (Critical Distinction)

You can be balanced on sliders and still unstable.

If gain is high.

Example:

Calm thoughts at panic volume.

You can also be mildly imbalanced and function well.

If gain is low.

Stability = Slider position + Gain level.

Both matter.

Always.


---

Directional Mobility in Experience

When awareness is wide, attention becomes mobile.

Internally, experience has directions:

Toward / Away

Up / Down

Expand / Contract

Engage / Release


You can feel these directly when regulated.

Calibration trains voluntary movement between them.


---

Expansion and Contraction

Expansion = widening the field
Contraction = narrowing the field

These directly affect gain.

Expansion → lowers intensity
Contraction → raises intensity

Under stress, most people contract automatically.

Training restores choice.


---

The Calibration Sweep

This is the core protocol.

It trains proprioception of your own system.

Step 1 — Establish Awareness

Widen awareness.

Include:

Body
Breath
Posture
Emotional tone


---

Step 2 — Sample +10

Lightly approach “too much.”

Do not push.

Just sample.

Notice the signature.


---

Step 3 — Sample –10

Lightly approach “too little.”

Again: sample.

Do not collapse.

Notice the signature.


---

Step 4 — Return to Center

Stop adjusting.

Let the system settle.

Notice where it stabilizes.

That is your current zero.


---

Sweeping the Whole Board

You can sweep:

Emotion

Energy

Attention

Motivation

Social tone

Effort


One channel at a time.

Or globally.

With practice, this takes seconds.


---

What Zero Actually Feels Like

Zero is not flat.

Zero is:

Breathable
Spacious
Alert
Comfortable
Responsive

There is energy.

No strain.

Interest without urgency.
Presence without pressure.


---

Why Zero Is Not Numbness

Numbness is:

Low gain + frozen sliders.

Zero is:

Balanced sliders + live gain.

Numbness feels dead.

Zero feels steady and alive.

If you feel foggy or blank:

That is under-arousal.

Not calibration.


---

Common Misinterpretation

“I feel calm, so I’m calibrated.”

False.

Collapse often feels calm.

True zero feels:

Clear
Stable
Available

You can move from it.


---

The Control Interface Metaphor

Think of your system like a multidirectional controller.

You can adjust:

Direction
Intensity
Range
Speed

Calibration teaches you where center is.

Without center, every move is guesswork.


---

Training Effect

With repetition:

You find zero faster

You drift less

You recover quicker

You waste less energy


This is nervous system fitness.

Not philosophy.


---

When to Calibrate

Calibrate:

Before pricing
Before conflict
Before decisions
After stress
When frozen
When scattered

Zero first.
Action second.


---

Calibration Before PEP

PEP only works near center.

If you price at +7 fear or –6 collapse:

Your numbers will distort.

If you negotiate at +8 urgency:

Your boundaries will fail.

Calibration is the foundation.

Everything else stands on it.
