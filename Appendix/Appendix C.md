Appendix C

Calibration Scripts

Direct Practices for Resetting Your System

These are not meditations.

They are operational procedures.

They exist to restore clean signal before action.

They work by acting directly on:

Attention

Breath

Muscle tone

Arousal

Posture


No belief required.
No special mindset required.

Just mechanics.

How to Use These Scripts

These practices are training tools, not prescriptions.

They are not magic.
They are not “correct forms.”
They are not something you must perform perfectly.

They exist to train specific capacities:

Detection

Contrast

Modulation

Stability

Recovery


You can build these capacities many ways.

These scripts are simply efficient drills.

If another activity trains the same skills, it counts.

PEP is skill-based.
Not form-based.


---

About Time Estimates

All time ranges in this appendix are suggestions.

They are based on:

Average autonomic response times

Early-stage skill acquisition

Fatigue thresholds


Some days you will need less.
Some days more.

Do not turn timing into a rule.

If regulation improves, the practice worked.

Script 1 — Guided ±10 Sweep

(Full Board Reset)

Purpose

Restore sliders and gain toward neutral.

Trains

Somatic awareness

Contrast detection

Arousal modulation

Return-to-center skill


Use When

Overloaded

Numb

Scattered

Frozen

Unable to choose


Suggested Time: 3–7 minutes


---

Step 1 — Stabilize Posture

Sit or stand comfortably.

Spine upright but relaxed

Jaw loose

Shoulders down


Let weight drop into the ground or chair.

Do not “try” to relax.

Let gravity assist.


---

Step 2 — Establish Reference

Choose one anchor:

Breath at the nose

Pressure through feet or chair


Stay for 3 natural breaths (suggested).

This is your baseline.


---

Step 3 — Sweep Up (+10)

Create controlled intensity.

Make a gentle fist.
Lightly tense hands, feet, jaw.
Firm posture slightly.

Do not strain.
Do not force.

Feel:

Pressure

Heat

Activation

Urgency


Notice where it gathers.

Hold ~5–10 seconds (suggested).

You are sampling high gain — not living there.


---

Step 4 — Sweep Down (–10)

Release deliberately.

Open hands.
Drop shoulders.
Soften belly and face.

Let energy drain.

Feel:

Heaviness

Slowing

Softness

Deactivation


Hold ~5–10 seconds (suggested).

You are sampling low gain — not collapsing.


---

Step 5 — Find Neutral (0)

Release both extremes.

Do nothing.

Let the system settle.

Signs of functional neutral:

Breath smooth

Body quiet

Thoughts slower

No urgency

No collapse


Neutral is not blank.

Neutral is usable.


---

Step 6 — Micro-Adjust

Make small corrections.

If tense → soften ~5%
If flat → energize ~5%

Stay in:

Alive and calm.


---

Completion

Move slowly.

Re-enter activity.


---

Notes

If you feel “nothing” → you are still building contrast sensitivity.
If vague → stay longer.
If intense → shorten.

Sensitivity increases with repetition.


---

Script 2 — SBR Practice

(Stare — Breathe — Relax)

Purpose

Maintain coherence under load.

Trains

Attention stability

Gain regulation

Tension release

Isometric balance


Use When

Working

Negotiating

Studying

Selling

Creating

Problem-solving


Suggested Time: 30 seconds – 2 minutes


---

Step 1 — STARE (Contain)

Pick one object:

Document

Person

Screen

Problem

Body sensation


Hold attention gently.

If it drifts, return.

No correction narrative.

~10–15 seconds (suggested).

This is containment.


---

Step 2 — BREATHE (Synchronize)

Match breath to task load.

Slow work → slower breath

Fast work → steady breath


Typical pattern (optional guideline):

Inhale ~4 seconds
Exhale ~6 seconds

Do not force rhythm.

Allow synchronization.

Breath modulates gain.


---

Step 3 — RELAX (Discharge)

Scan for excess tension:

Jaw

Neck

Belly

Hands

Thighs


Release about 20%.

Not all.

Just waste.


---

Loop

Repeat:

Stare → Breathe → Relax

Every 30–90 seconds (as needed).


---

Emphasis Adjustments

If scattered → emphasize Stare
If rushed → emphasize Relax
If sleepy → emphasize Stare + upright posture


---

Script 3 — Pre-Decision Reset

(Before Important Choices)

Purpose

Remove distortion before commitment.

Trains

Impulse control

Attachment awareness

Decision hygiene

Latency reduction


Use Before

Pricing

Signing

Agreeing

Saying yes/no

Sending messages

Major purchases


Suggested Time: ~90 seconds


---

Step 1 — Pause

Stop physically.

Hands still.
Eyes soft.

~5 seconds.

Interrupt momentum.


---

Step 2 — Mini Sweep

Quick contrast:

Tense → release → settle.

~15 seconds (suggested).


---

Step 3 — One SBR Cycle

Stare → Breathe → Relax

~20 seconds.

Restore coherence.


---

Step 4 — Signal Check

Ask internally:

Am I pressured?

Am I proving something?

Am I escaping something?

Am I afraid?


If yes → regulate again.

If stable → proceed.


---

Step 5 — 51/49 Break (If Needed)

If stuck between viable options:

Weight one side 51%.

Act.

Motion reduces latency.


---

Step 6 — Commit Cleanly

No replay.
No apology.
No rumination.

Decision becomes data.


---

Emergency Version (~15 Seconds)

When no time:

Inhale once
Exhale twice
Drop shoulders
Act

Enough to prevent impulse.


---

Training Schedule (Suggested)

Examples, not requirements.

Daily
→ One ±10 sweep

Before work
→ One SBR cycle

Before decisions
→ Pre-reset

Weekly
→ 5-minute calibration session

Adjust freely.

Consistency matters more than duration.


---

Common Difficulties

“I feel nothing.”
→ Early stage. Normal.

“I feel worse.”
→ You’re detecting noise. Good sign.

“I can’t focus.”
→ Shorten session.

“It doesn’t work today.”
→ System fatigued. Rest first.


---

What These Scripts Are Really Training

All scripts train the same core capacities:

Detection — noticing shifts early

Contrast — sensing high vs low

Modulation — adjusting smoothly

Recovery — returning quickly

Stability — holding center


If another practice builds these, it counts.

Walking.
Martial arts.
Yoga.
Craft work.
Breathwork.
Manual labor.

The form is flexible.

The skill is not.


---

Integration With PEP

These scripts support:

PEP #1 → Clean pricing
PEP #2 → Clean boundaries
PEP #3 → Clean social engagement
PEP #4 → Clean decisions

Without regulation → PEP becomes performance.
With regulation → PEP becomes automatic.


---

Final Compression

Do not ritualize this.
Do not perform this.
Do not perfect this.

Use it.

Reset before action.
Stabilize before choice.
Unload before commitment.

That is the system.
