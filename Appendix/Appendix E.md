Bounded-Sphere Regulation Model (v1.0 — Polished)
Part II: Identity Distortion, Practice, and Application

8) Identity Fusion: The Hidden Amplifier
Identity fusion occurs when:
“I am X”
 becomes
 “I must do Y or I am unsafe.”
Examples:
“I’m strong, so I never rest.”
“I’m spiritual, so I never get angry.”
“I’m responsible, so I never say no.”
“I’m competent, so I must never fail.”
“I’m a good parent, so I must exhaust myself.”
Fusion converts manageable challenges
 into existential threats.
Threat perception spikes gain.

9) Mechanical Effect of Fusion
When fusion is active:
gain rises faster
capacity contracts
recovery slows
correction becomes harder
thresholds arrive sooner
Fusion is not an axis.
It is a gain-lock.
It overrides normal regulation.
The system cannot downshift
 while identity is at stake.

10) Related Distortions
All function as threat amplifiers:
rigid “how it’s supposed to be” beliefs
fixed role scripts
perfectionism
catastrophic doubt
moralized effort
comparison addiction
They convert neutral information
 into danger signals.
The body reacts as if survival is at risk.

11) Regulation Procedure (SBR-Based)
Before acting under load:
Apply SBR (Stare — Breathe — Relax)
Check current gain
Identify active domain
Estimate current capacity
Choose small direction
Apply minimal force
Hold steadily
Regulation precedes optimization.
Always.
Skipping this sequence
 creates unstable output.

12) Neutral +1 Strategy
Default posture:
Remain near neutral.
 Add small positive bias.
Sustained +1
 outperforms repeated +7 followed by collapse.
Growth is cumulative.
 Crashes are subtractive.
Most mastery is quiet.

13) Boundaries as Status Reports
Boundaries are not accusations.
They are telemetry.
Examples:
“I don’t have capacity.”
“That’s above my ceiling.”
“Not today.”
“I need recovery first.”
Information-first delivery
 reduces conflict.
Drama indicates unregulated gain.

14) Objection Handling
“This is too mechanical.”
Human systems are mechanical.
Ignoring mechanics
 does not produce freedom.
It produces breakdown.

“Intensity is bad.”
Unregulated intensity is bad.
Regulated intensity
 builds capacity.

“This promotes selfishness.”
It promotes sustainability.
Burned-out people
 help no one.

“This is just assertiveness training.”
No.
It is coherence training.
Behavior changes
 because physiology stabilizes.

15) Implementation Schema (Optional)
For tracking, tooling, or journaling:
domain_id
axes: [x, y, z…]
gain
capacity
fusion_flags
threshold_zone
Track patterns.
Not perfection.
Data enables recalibration.

16) One-Line Summary
Stability arises from managing direction, intensity, and duration within real capacity, while preventing identity-based threat from hijacking gain.
