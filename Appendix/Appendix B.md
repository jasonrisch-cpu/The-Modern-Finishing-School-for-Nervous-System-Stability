How PEP Looks in Real Life

PEP is not a theory.

It is a procedure.

The fastest way to learn it is to see it applied.

These examples show how calibration, envelopes, and feedback work together across different domains.

They are here to teach mechanics.

Not to give you numbers to copy.


---

How to Read These Examples

These examples are models, not instructions.

They are not “correct prices.”
They are not recommendations.
They are not templates to imitate.

They demonstrate:

How envelopes are built

How calibration guides placement

How gain and identity affect pricing

How feedback refines decisions


The specific numbers do not matter.

The process does.

If you copy numbers without understanding the regulation behind them, the system will fail.

These examples show:

> “What it looks like when the system is working.”



Not:

> “What you are supposed to charge.”



Use them to learn the structure.

Then build your own.

Example 1 — Unit Cost (Artisan / Maker)

Context

Handmade leather wallet sold at local markets.


---

Step 1 — Calculate C (True Cost)

Materials

Leather: $6
Thread, dye, finish: $2
Tool wear (estimated): $1

System Maintenance

Booth fees (pro-rated): $2
Transport (pro-rated): $1

C = $12
(Time excluded — hobby/side income)


---

Step 2 — Build Envelope

Floor: 3 × 12 = $36
Center: 6 × 12 = $72
Ceiling: 12 × 12 = $144

Envelope: $36–$144


---

Step 3 — Calibrate

±10 sweep:

$36 → feels tight, survivable
$72 → relaxed, confident
$144 → inflated

Neutral: ~$65


---

Step 4 — Set Price

Posted price: $65


---

Outcome

Regular sales
No resentment
Sustainable production


---

Lesson

Unit cost mode works best for:

Crafts

Art objects

Physical products

Discrete items



---

Example 2 — Hourly Cost (Consultant / Service Worker)

Context

Freelance marketing consultant.
Primary income source.


---

Step 1 — Calculate C (Hourly)

Monthly Life Costs

Rent: $1,200
Utilities: $200
Food: $500
Insurance: $300
Misc: $300

Total: $2,500

Work hours/month: ~120
Life cost/hour: $21

Business Costs

Software: $200/month → $1.67/hr
Phone/internet: $100 → $0.83/hr

C ≈ $24/hr
Rounded: $25/hr


---

Step 2 — Build Envelope

Floor: $75/hr
Center: $150/hr
Ceiling: $300/hr


---

Step 3 — Calibrate

$75 → anxious
$150 → solid
$300 → uncomfortable

Neutral: ~$140


---

Step 4 — Set Rate

Public rate: $140/hr


---

Outcome

Fewer clients
Higher quality
Less burnout
More savings


---

Lesson

Hourly mode fits:

Consulting

Care work

Coaching

Contract services



---

Example 3 — Hybrid Mode (Trucker / Contractor)

Context

Independent trucker hauling regional freight.
Costs vary by job and time.


---

Step 1 — Calculate Base C

Per Mile

Fuel: $0.40
Maintenance: $0.15
Insurance: $0.10
Depreciation: $0.20

C/mile = $0.85

Per Day (Fixed)

Food: $25
Parking: $15
Admin: $10

Daily C = $50


---

Step 2 — Job Example

500-mile haul, 2 days.

Mileage: 500 × 0.85 = $425
Daily: 2 × 50 = $100

C = $525


---

Step 3 — Envelope

Floor: $1,575
Center: $3,150
Ceiling: $6,300


---

Step 4 — Price

Quoted: $2,900


---

Outcome

Profitable runs
Declines bad routes
Predictable income


---

Lesson

Hybrid mode fits:

Transport

Construction

Installation

Field services



---

Example 4 — Multi-Mode Practitioner

Context

Graphic designer with two income streams.


---

Mode A — Print Sales

C = $15/print

Envelope:
$45 / $90 / $180

Price: $75


---

Mode B — Client Work

C = $40/hr

Envelope:
$120 / $240 / $480

Rate: $200/hr


---

Outcome

No internal conflict
Clean accounting
Stable workload


---

Lesson

Mode-switching is healthy when it reflects:

Different cost structures

Different risk profiles

Different energy demands


Not avoidance.


---

Example 5 — Crisis Override (Emergency Mode)

Context

Freelancer faces medical emergency.
Immediate cash needed.


---

Normal C

C = $30/hr
Floor = $90/hr


---

Crisis Adjustment

Short-term survival mode.

Temporary pricing:

$60/hr for 2 weeks

Below floor.


---

Recovery Protocol

After crisis:

1. Return to normal envelope


2. Rebuild buffer


3. Recalibrate



No shame.
No normalization.


---

Outcome

Crisis handled without collapse.


---

Lesson

Below-floor pricing is allowed:

Short-term

Transparent

Temporary


Never permanent.


---

Important: Do Not Imitate Outcomes

Do not aim to reproduce these prices.

Aim to reproduce:

Honest costing

Bounded envelopes

Somatic calibration

Feedback adjustment

Clean iteration


If your numbers differ, that is expected.

If your regulation improves, the system is working.


---

Cross-Example Patterns

Across all cases:

1. C is honest


2. Envelope is bounded


3. Calibration guides placement


4. Feedback refines future decisions



That is the system.

How to Use This Pack

When stuck:

Find the closest example
Map your situation onto it
Adjust parameters
Test
Review

Repeat.


---

Final Compression

These examples illustrate structure, not authority.

You are the instrument.
Not the book.

PEP works because it turns pricing into a skill loop.

Not a personality test.
Not a moral drama.
Not a guessing game.

Just:

Calculate → Bracket → Calibrate → Act → Learn

That’s it.
