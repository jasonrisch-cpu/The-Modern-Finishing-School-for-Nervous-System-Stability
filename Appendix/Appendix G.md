Core Operational Terms of the PEP System

This glossary defines how key terms are used in this system.

Many of these words exist elsewhere.
Here, they have precise mechanical meanings.

Read them as tools.
Not as beliefs.


---

Gain

Definition
The global intensity level of the nervous system.

Gain determines how “loud” life feels.

High Gain

Everything feels urgent

Emotions amplify

Thoughts accelerate

Errors increase


Low Gain

Everything feels distant

Motivation drops

Awareness dulls

Initiative fades


Moderate Gain (Optimal)

Clear perception

Stable energy

Flexible response


Gain is the master volume knob.

Most failures are gain failures first.


---

Slider

Definition
A controllable behavioral or emotional dimension with two poles.

Each slider ranges roughly from −10 to +10.

Examples

Approach / Avoid

Assert / Withdraw

Attach / Detach

Push / Collapse

Control / Surrender


Extreme positions destabilize.
Mid-range positions sustain.

Sliders shape direction.
Gain shapes force.


---

Envelope

Definition
A bounded range inside which behavior remains sustainable.

Every envelope has:

A Floor (minimum viable level)

A Ceiling (maximum stable level)


Inside → Clean function
Outside → Distortion

Examples

Price envelope

Energy envelope

Time envelope

Boundary envelope


Envelopes protect system viability.


---

Calibration

Definition
The process of returning the system toward neutral.

Calibration restores:

Clear perception

Balanced energy

Reliable judgment


It is performed through:

Awareness

Contrast

Breathing

Releasing tension


Calibration precedes optimization.

Always.


---

Neutral (Zero)

Definition
Balanced baseline state.

Not numb.
Not flat.
Not passive.

Zero is:

Awake

Calm

Responsive

Stable


Zero is where choice becomes possible.


---

SBR (Stare–Breathe–Relax)

Definition
A three-phase regulation cycle for maintaining coherence under load.

Stare — contain attention

Breathe — synchronize rhythm

Relax — discharge excess tension


SBR provides damping.

It prevents oscillation.


---

Heuristic

Definition
A practical rule that enables action without requiring certainty.

Heuristics are “good enough” tools.

Examples

3 / 6 / 12 envelope

51/49 rule

±10 sweep

+1 baseline


Heuristics preserve motion.

They defeat paralysis.


---

Window of Tolerance

Definition
The arousal range where performance remains stable.

Below Window

Collapse

Numbness

Disengagement


Inside Window

Focus

Learning

Adaptation


Above Window

Panic

Impulsivity

Burnout


This system trains living inside the window.


---

Symmetry Break

Definition
A deliberate action used to escape indecision.

When options feel equal, the system freezes.

A symmetry break introduces motion.

Example

51% vs 49%

Movement generates data.
Stalling generates noise.


---

Delta Detection

Definition
The ability to notice change in real time.

Operational memory.

It asks:

“What shifted?”

Instead of:

“What do I remember?”

Delta detection enables early correction.

Without it, drift accumulates.


---

Regulation

Definition
The capacity to keep arousal, emotion, and cognition within usable ranges.

Regulation is:

Mechanical

Trainable

Observable


It is not “calming down.”

It is maintaining coherence.


---

Dysregulation

Definition
Loss of control over gain and sliders.

Signs

Overreaction

Shutdown

Rumination

Compulsion

Avoidance


Dysregulation is overload.

Not moral failure.


---

Clean Price

Definition
A price chosen without fear, guilt, or defensiveness.

A clean price:

Fits inside the envelope

Feels calm to state

Requires no apology

Allows flexibility


If shame or urgency is present, the price is distorted.


---

Sovereignty

Definition
The capacity to self-regulate across domains.

A sovereign person:

Does not outsource regulation

Chooses under pressure

Disengages cleanly

Is not driven by panic

Is not ruled by craving


Sovereignty is internal stability.

Not dominance.
Not ego.
Not isolation.


---

Identity Fusion

Definition
When self-concept becomes linked to threat.

“I am X” becomes:

“I must do Y or I am unsafe.”

Fusion locks gain high.

It hijacks regulation.


---

Envelope Violation

Definition
Sustained behavior outside sustainable bounds.

Examples

Chronic underpricing

Chronic overwork

Chronic people-pleasing

Chronic isolation


Violations accumulate debt.

Collapse follows.


---

Latency

Definition
Delay caused by unresolved internal conflict.

Latency is frozen energy.

It appears as:

Overthinking

Hesitation

Avoidance


Resolved by: Regulation + symmetry break.


---

Instrumentation

Definition
The skill of reading internal states.

Instrumentation answers:

“What is happening in me right now?”

Without it, control is impossible.


---

Operational Language

Definition
Language designed for action, not belief.

If a term cannot guide behavior, it is revised or discarded.

This system uses operational language exclusively.


---

Witness Position

Definition
The stable reference point of awareness.

Not mystical.

It is the perspective that notices experience.

It enables regulation.

Without it, you are submerged in content.


---

Safety Margin

Definition
Excess capacity built into life systems.

Examples

Financial buffers

Time buffers

Energy buffers

Emotional buffers


Safety margins prevent collapse.

Fragile systems lack them.


---

Community Extraction

Definition
Using others’ labor, attention, or trust without reciprocity.

Extraction destabilizes groups.

PEP discourages extraction.

Stability scales.


---

Capacity

Definition
Current tolerance for load.

Capacity is:

Variable

Asymmetric

Exhaustible

Trainable


Most people overestimate capacity.

Calibration corrects this.


---

Damping

Definition
Mechanisms that prevent oscillation.

In this system, damping is primarily provided by:

SBR

Relaxation

Awareness expansion


Without damping, systems overshoot.


---

Isometric Balance

Definition
Holding opposing forces in equilibrium.

Power without distortion.

Example:

Firm boundaries without anger.
Engagement without obsession.

This is trained stability.


---

Final Compression

Gain = How loud
Sliders = How directed
Envelope = Where safe
Calibration = How reset
SBR = How hold
Heuristics = How move
Sovereignty = Where it leads
