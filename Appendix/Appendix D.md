Bounded-Sphere Regulation Model (v1.0 — Polished)

Part I: Functional Geometry of Stability, Load, and Self-Regulation


---

Purpose

This document describes a functional mechanical model for:

nervous system regulation

stability under load

boundary setting

clean decision-making

sustainable effort

identity-based distortion


It is:

functional, not metaphysical

descriptive, not moral

practical, not ideological


No belief is required.

No identity is required.


---

Core Principle

Direction is not damage.

Damage emerges from:

Direction × Gain × Duration
relative to Capacity.

Most breakdown is not caused by “being wrong.”

It is caused by applying too much force
for too long
in systems with insufficient margin.


---

1) State Space: The Bounded Sphere

An individual’s regulatory state can be modeled as a moving point
inside a bounded, multidimensional state space.

Visually:

the center = neutral regulation

distance from center = regulatory load

the boundary = current capacity limit


The system is dynamic.

The boundary shifts with:

sleep
stress
nutrition
trauma load
training
context

Capacity must be reassessed regularly.

This is a functional regulation geometry.
Not a personality map.


---

2) Axes (Sliders)

Each axis represents a continuous control surface
that affects system stability.

Each runs from:

–10 ←→ +10
with 0 as neutral.

These are not moral values.

They are control parameters.

Examples:

arousal: hyper ↔ hypo

effort: overdrive ↔ collapse

attention: overfocus ↔ scatter

tension: rigid ↔ loose

emotional charge: spike ↔ shutdown


Axes must be domain-specific.

A body axis is not a relationship axis.
A money axis is not a mood axis.
A leadership axis is not an intimacy axis.

Do not mix domains.

Cross-domain confusion produces chronic miscalibration.


---

3) Capacity Radius

The sphere boundary represents current tolerance.

Inside it:
regulation is reliable.

Near it:
effort rises and recovery slows.

Beyond it:
breakdown occurs.

Capacity is:

time-variable

asymmetric

trainable

exhaustible

resource-dependent


Most people overestimate capacity.

They assume yesterday’s strength
still applies today.

Often, it does not.


---

4) Threshold Zones

Within each domain, four functional zones appear:

Neutral Zone

Low load
High control
Fast recovery

Stretch Zone

Challenging
Growth possible
Requires attention

Warning Zone

Pain
Irritability
Cognitive narrowing
Delayed recovery

Collapse Zone

Shutdown
Explosive reaction
Burnout
Dissociation

The system signals before failure.

Early detection is skill.


---

5) Gain (Master Amplifier)

Gain is overall system intensity.

It corresponds to:

arousal

urgency

emotional charge

pressure

internal force


High displacement with low gain is often safe.

Low displacement with high gain is often dangerous.

Most damage arises from unmanaged gain.

Not from incorrect direction.


---

6) Isometric Holding

Stability requires holding input
without escalation.

Driving example:

set steering

set throttle

hold both steady


Nervous system example:

set boundary

set tone

hold calmly


Escalation usually indicates loss of regulation.

Not strength.


---

7) Domain Safety Rules

Only treat something as an axis if it is:

1. continuous


2. measurable


3. stability-relevant


4. threshold-sensitive



Do not turn categories into sliders.
Do not turn symbols into mechanics.
Do not turn ideology into “science.”

Precision preserves usefulness.
